                    <p class="text-justify">Paul confesses that prior to his conversion he persecuted 
                    "beyond measure" the church of God. Paul's initial persecution 
                    of Christians probably was directed against the Greek-speaking "Hellenists" converted 
                    to Christianity due to their anti-Temple attitude. Within the early Jewish Christian 
                    community, this also set them apart from the "Hebrews" and their continuing participation 
                    in the Temple cult. Paul's conversion can be dated to by his reference to 
                    it in one of his letters. In Galatians 1:16 Paul writes that God "was pleased to reveal his 
                    son to me." In 1 Corinthians 15:8, as he lists the order in which Jesus appeared to his 
                    disciples after his resurrection, Paul writes :"last of all, as to one untimely born, 
                    He appeared to me also."</p>
